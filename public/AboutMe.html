<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
  <!-- First subsection -->
<section class="hobbies">
  <h3>&#9733; Playing video games</h3>
  <h4>I love playing video games.</h4>
  <p>As you may already know,many video games require some serious strategy and concentration. If you have ever built your own civilization in <strong>Minecraft</strong>
     or fought for your life in <strong>Fortnite</strong>, you know how important it is to remember where you found specific resources or where you need to go next.
    <br>Navigating the virtual world of video games is now very similar to navigating the real world, so this is mainly why I love them.They are giving me a real feel about how I should behave in certain circumstances.

<h3>&#9733;Travelling</h3>
<h4>Traveling lets you appreciate beauty and ignite creativity</h4>
<p>Going on road trips, cuisines, learning the culture and exploring new places does rivet most people.
 Traveling is rejuvenating and fun as well. It enriches your soul.
You leave a small part of yourself with the travel diaries and get to learn more about yourself.</p>
<img src="images/travel.gif" alt="Travelling" class="pic">
 <p>World's best places to live:</p>
   <ul>
     <li><strong>British Virgin Islands. </strong></li>
     <li><strong>Santorini.</strong></li>
     <li><strong>South Island, New Zealand</strong></li>

<h3>&#9733;Cooking</h3>
<h4>Cooking with love provides food for the soulâ€¦</h4>
<p>I find cooking as a very relaxing task to be engaged in. Hunting through the refrigerator, collecting the ingredients, preparing them and putting them
  together to make something delicious, puts me in a much relaxed mood than sitting on the couch and watching a movie.
  I have never felt stressed while cooking.
</p>
<img src="images/cook.gif" alt="Cooking" class="pic">
<p>My favourite cooking recipes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pan-Roasted Salmon with Arugula and Avocado Salad</strong></li>
<li> <strong>Spicy Cilantro Shrimp with Honey-Lime Dipping Sauce.</strong> </li>
<li> <strong>Macarons</strong> </li>

</ul>
