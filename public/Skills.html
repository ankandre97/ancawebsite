<h2>What are and why we need CSS("Cascading Style Sheet") and ECMAScript("European Computer Manufacturers Association Script")</h2>

<section>
<p>"CSS" stands for <strong>"Cascading Style Sheet."</strong> <strong>Cascading style sheets</strong> are used to format the layout of Web pages.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>text-styles</li>
    <li>table-sizes</li>
<li>other aspects of Web pages that previously could only be defined in a page's HTML.</li> </ol>
</section>
<main>
  <p><strong>CSS</strong> helps Web developers create a uniform look across several pages of a Web site.
  Instead of defining the style of each table and each block of text within a page's HTML, commonly used styles need to be defined only once in a <strong>CSS</strong> document.<br>
  Once the style is defined in cascading style sheet, it can be used by any page that references the <strong>CSS</strong> file.
   Plus, <strong>CSS</strong> makes it easy to change styles across several pages at once.
    <br>For example, a Web developer may want to increase the default text size from 10pt to 12pt for fifty pages of a Web site.
   If the pages all reference the same style sheet, the text size only needs to be changed on the style sheet and all the pages will show the larger text.
<br><br><br>
<p><strong>ECMAScript</strong> is a standard script language, developed with the cooperation of <em>Netscape</em> and <em>Microsoft</em> and mainly derived from <em>Netscape's JavaScript</em>,
the widely-used scripting language that is used in Web pages to affect how they look or behave for the user.
 <br>The official standard, ECMA-262, was developed under the auspices of the <strong>European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA)</strong>.</p>
 Having the ECMAScript standard will help ensure more consistency between Netscape, Microsoft, and any other Web script implementations.<br>
 <strong>ECMAScript</strong> is object-oriented and conceived as a core language to which can be added the objects of any specific domain or context such as the idea of a "document."
(for example, the <strong>World Wide Web Consortium's Document Object Model</strong>). <br>  <strong>ECMAScript</strong> together with the <strong>Document Object Model</strong> corresponds closely to the current implementations of
  <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>JScript</strong> . Although likely to be used mainly as a standard script language for the World Wide Web, <strong>ECMAScript</strong> could also be used for any scripted application.
  <hr>Below, there is a demonstration about how important is the CSS for the webpage,and how much it helps you to design.CSS1 and CSS2 are having the exact html,just the css being different.
  Moreover,you will see an application for ordering and pricing using <strong>HTML,CSS and ECMAScript</strong>.

  <h2>My first page-CSS1</h2>
  <p><a href="Design1.html" class="button">Checkout the CSS1 Page</a></p>
<img src="forskills/css1.jpg" alt="CSS1" class="skillspic">
<p>In this webpage I wanted to concentrate more on the light colors like: orange,pink and blue.Also I did create containers with the background color as gradient and responsive for all the devices. </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>My second page-CSS2</h2>
  <p><a href="Design2.html" class="button">Checkout the CSS2 Page</a></p>
<img src="forskills/css2.jpg" alt="CSS2" class="skillspic">
<p>Here, I wanted to concentrate more for dark colours like: green,darkblue and violet. The webpage is again,responsive,but it looks a little bit more too clasic,but still nice.
 </p>

  <p><a href="ECMAScript.html" class="button">Checkout the Coffee Application</a></p>
